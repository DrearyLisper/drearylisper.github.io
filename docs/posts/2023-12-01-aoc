<h2 id="advent-of-code">Advent of Code</h2>
<p>Another year has passed, which means itâ€™s time to start solving <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023">Advent of Code</a> again. Probably everyone is already familiar with <strong>AoC</strong>, but let me still remind you that this site provides you with a new coding problem every day and by solving them gets us closer to the actual Christmas.</p>
<p>This is third year when I use only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming languages</a> to solve the AoC problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>2021 was <a href="https://github.com/DrearyLisper/aoc-2021">year of Haskell</a></li>
<li>2022 was <a href="https://github.com/DrearyLisper/aoc-2022">year of OCaml</a></li>
<li>And this 2023 year will be <a href="https://github.com/DrearyLisper/aoc-2023">year of Clojure!</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This time additionally to solutions of the problems in GitHub, I am going to publish explanations which will be generated automatically <a href="aoc-2023">from code online</a>.</p>
<p>All of it became possible with extensive capabilities of Clojure and <a href="https://clerk.vision/">Clerk library</a>. In this note I will share how online publishing works in details.</p>
