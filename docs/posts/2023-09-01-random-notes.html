        <p>Originally I wanted to use this blog to write about some really technical things which are potentially interesting to only small group of people. Algorithms, data structures, programming languages, compilers, etc.
I haven’t been very productive recently, so now it is a good time for a few sentences which start with word <strong>Unfortunately</strong>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong>Unfortunately</strong> every time when I start working on an article, I understand that it probably will be taking time which I won’t be able to afford spending on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately</strong> I don’t want to lower the quality of my posts and publish them before I feel that they are ready to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately</strong> it brings me to the point that all my thoughts and ideas are staying in the draft state and never see the light.</p>
<p>For now I have no idea what should I do with it. It would be great to publish my thoughts more regularly and don’t feel the burden of being not perfect at the same time.</p>
